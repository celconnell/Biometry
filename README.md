###### *NOTE: All R code in this repository are either in their original R Markdown format or R script format. I am actively converting and editing all R Markdown files into R scripts for reproducibility and brevity. I took this course in Fall 2018 and started uploading files to Github in March 2019. This repo was <u>not</u> used during the time I was enrolled in the course.*
